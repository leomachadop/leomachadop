**Professional Background:**

I have a robust background in backend development, spanning over a decade since 2008. Throughout my career, I've been deeply immersed in the Java world, diligently updating frameworks and embracing new Java versions up until version 9. After 2021, my journey in the programming landscape expanded, delving into Kotlin and briefly exploring Golang, a language I found particularly intriguing. This expansion correlated with my foray into the realm of microservices and AWS, where I found the intersection of efficiency and performance.

**Technical Expertise:**

Within the Java and Kotlin domains, I command an array of frameworks, including Spring, Spring-boot, Spring-batch, Micronaut, Hibernate, JPA, Java EE, Itext, JasperReport, JSF, and Primefaces. I possess in-depth knowledge of databases, primarily Oracle, with additional experience in projects involving PostgreSQL and Cassandra. My expertise extends to MongoDB, where I have a solid foundational understanding.

**Code Design and Development Practices:**

I am passionate about code quality, considering it a cornerstone of my work. To ensure impeccable quality, I employ methodologies such as TDD, unit tests, integration tests, pair programming, and rigorous code review. My affinity for software architecture is reflected in my appreciation for patterns like Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and GoF design patterns.
I furthered my understanding through a postgraduate research endeavor focused on Code Review, exploring its multifaceted benefits.

**Project Contributions and Expertise:**

I have actively contributed to significant regulatory projects in Brazil, including <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/exibenormativo?tipo=Circular&numero=3952">Circular 3952</a>, enabling commercial establishments to leverage receivables for credit, and <a href="https://openbankingbrasil.org.br/?cookie=true">Open Finance Brazil</a>, a transformative initiative enhancing financial choices through data sharing. I firmly believe in the power of financial inclusion and its pivotal role in a country's growth, <a href="https://github.com/leomachadop/leomachadop/blob/main/certificates/open-finance-certificate.png">see the certificate</a>.

**Ongoing Education and Career Aspirations:**

My quest for knowledge is ceaseless. Currently enrolled in postgraduate courses, one in Finance, Investments, and Banking and another in Data Science and Big Data, I aim to bridge the gap between financial expertise and cutting-edge technology. To apply my learnings, I am developing an ambitious project, the Autonomous Financial Planner, encompassing various platforms and languages. My future aspirations revolve around specializing in the financial market, deepening my expertise in AWS, and becoming a data expert applied to the financial domain.

**Closing Note:**

In essence, my career is a tapestry woven with diverse experiences, relentless pursuit of knowledge, and unwavering commitment to code excellence. My journey, marked by significant projects and ongoing education, propels me toward a future where technology and finance harmonize to create innovative solutions.
